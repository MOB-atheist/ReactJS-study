These are the directories that we are actively using in the development:

+ [assets](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/ReactJS-study/assets): The assets are used to store the application.
+ [index.html](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/ReactJS-study/assets/index.html): Template used by webpacker, DO NOT ADD SCRIPT OR LINK TAGS IN THIS FILE, those will be generated by the webpacker.
+ [public](): Where the app is compiled.

### assets

+ js /
+ css /

#### js
As the name implies, here is where all the javascript fonts and javascript frameworks reside. When you want to make changes, please minify the javascript and then upload.

#### css
